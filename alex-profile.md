As the head of quantitative analysis at Topaz Tech, Alex is responsible for providing fast, accurate 
algorithms for the wide and ever increasing range of financial instruments supported. 
While focussing on financial maths at Topaz, Alex also has long experience of managing 
the building of risk systems from the ground up


Skills Overview
---------------

- A strong preference for practical and intuitive models, rather than the theoretical

- The ability to communicate complex financial ideas, often with people with limited
  technical experience

- Able to work closely with architects on application code and larger scale system design


Career Highlights
-----------------

- Worked as a fixed income derivatives trader, market-making both vanilla and exotic options, and 
  also identifying and profiting from various arbitrage and statistical arbitrage opportunities

- On several occasions have developed models for products not covered by the literature, or 
  made significant improvements to existing models

- In the commodities space, the majority of my modelling has been concerned with 
  the financialisation of physical assets, whose value can be a significant percentage of the 
  customer's assets.  These include, but are not limited to, hydro-electric dams, power stations,
  interruption rights, portfolios of LNG contracts and vessels.

  These often have highly specific real-world features, and typically require the design of new 
  price processes, while of course being consistent with related, standard traded instruments

- Together wih David Corcoran, built a monte-carlo grid which in an external audit 
  was rated as far superior to any of the existing commercial products
